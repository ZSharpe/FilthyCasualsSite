                    <p class="lead">
                        Since the age of 4, John’s been playing video games. The golden-age of his career was 1998 when Pokémon Red and Blue and the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time were released in North America. John enjoys the RPG epic as well as complex story-driven games, with beloved-ties to the original Mass Effect trilogy, The Witcher franchise, and Halos 1-3. John is a competitive snob who takes things too seriously, beating all of your friends in Smash Bros. Ultimate and getting frustrated on Bloodborne speedruns.

                        <br><br>
                        When not playing video games, John enjoys reading classic literature, playing his guitar, and working on his Olympic lifts. He guitars and runs audio for a living, and loves making content that people will find joy in. He and his wife, Rebecca, live in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in Nashville, TN and are working hard to save money to purchase a home.

                        Born in the ’80s, Brandon’s first memory of gaming was when he got a Sega Game Gear with Sonic the Hedgehog for Christmas. That sparked a love for video games that led to the SNES with Super Mario World, Donkey Kong Country, and Super Mario RPG as a few standout favorites. That love spread from Nintendo consoles to the Xbox platform and has been a fan of the art of gaming ever since.

                        <br><br>
                        Brandon grew up in the music business as a part of the pop group Jump5 and remembers enjoying spontaneous Halo tournaments on the tour bus between shows.
                        <br><br>
                        He lives in Nashville, TN with his wife and 3 little boys and is currently teaching them how to play the SNES Classic, just like how he started. Besides gaming, he enjoys music, woodworking, and vlogging their family adventures on YouTube.
