                    <p class="lead">
                        Since the age of 4, John’s been playing video games. The golden-age of his career was 1998 when Pokémon Red and Blue and the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time were released in North America. John enjoys the RPG epic as well as complex story-driven games, with beloved-ties to the original Mass Effect trilogy, The Witcher franchise, and Halos 1-3. John is a competitive snob who takes things too seriously, beating all of your friends in Smash Bros. Ultimate and getting frustrated on Bloodborne speedruns.

                        <br><br>
                        When not playing video games, John enjoys reading classic literature, playing his guitar, and working on his Olympic lifts. He guitars and runs audio for a living, and loves making content that people will find joy in. He and his wife, Rebecca, live in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in Nashville, TN and are working hard to save money to purchase a home.
